# By default the server will pretend to allow ASCII mode but in fact ignore

# This option is useful is conjunction with virtual users.
# It is used to automatically generate a home directory for each virtual user,
# based on a template. For example, if the home directory of the real user specified
# via guest_username is /home/virtual/$USER, and user_sub_token is set to $USER,
# then when virtual user fred logs in, he will end up (usually chroot()'ed)
# in the directory /home/virtual/fred. This option also takes affect if
# local_root contains user_sub_token.
#user_sub_token=$USER
#
# If enabled, vsftpd will load a list of usernames, from the filename given by
# userlist_file. If a user tries to log in using a name in this file, they will
# be denied before they are asked for a password. This may be useful in preventing
# cleartext passwords being transmitted. See also userlist_deny.

#
# This option is examined if userlist_enable is activated. If you set this setting to NO,
# then users will be denied login unless they are explicitly listed in the file specified
# by userlist_file. When login is denied, the denial is issued before the user is asked
# for a password.
