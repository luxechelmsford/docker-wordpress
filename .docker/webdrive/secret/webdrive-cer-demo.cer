Replace this file with a public certficate of your webdav server
This will prevent a 'y/N' prommpt for accepting a certificate when davfs2 try to mount the webdav remote path
This is perticularly importatnt if your webdav folder is like a NAS and the certificate on it not issued by a recgnised CA
If you have your webdav server with valid certificate, you can just leave this file as it
